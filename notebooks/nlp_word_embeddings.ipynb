    "Next, let's see how debiasing can also be applied to word pairs such as \"actress\" and \"actor.\" Equalization is applied to pairs of words that you might want to have differ only through the gender property. As a concrete example, suppose that \"actress\" is closer to \"babysit\" than \"actor.\" By applying neutralization to \"babysit,\" you can reduce the gender stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still does not guarantee that \"actor\" and \"actress\" are equidistant from \"babysit.\" The equalization algorithm takes care of this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind equalization is to make sure that a particular pair of words are equidistant from the 49-dimensional $g_\\perp$. The equalization step also ensures that the two equalized steps are now the same distance from $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$, or from any other work that has been neutralized. Visually, this is how equalization works: \n",

    "### Keras and Mini-batching \n",
    "\n",
    "Most deep learning frameworks require that all sequences in the same mini-batch have the **same length**. This is what allows vectorization to work: If you had a 3-word sentence and a 4-word sentence, then the computations needed for them are different (one takes 3 steps of an LSTM, one takes 4 steps) so it's just not possible to do them both at the same time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Padding Handles Sequences of Varying Length\n",
    "* The common solution to handling sequences of **different length** is to use padding.  Specifically:\n",
    "    * Set a maximum sequence length\n",
    "    * Pad all sequences to have the same length. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Example of Padding:\n",
    "* Given a maximum sequence length of 20, you could pad every sentence with \"0\"s so that each input sentence is of length 20. \n",
    "* Thus, the sentence \"I love you\" would be represented as $(e_{I}, e_{love}, e_{you}, \\vec{0}, \\vec{0}, \\ldots, \\vec{0})$. \n",
    "* In this example, any sentences longer than 20 words would have to be truncated. \n",
    "* One way to choose the maximum sequence length is to just pick the length of the longest sentence in the training set. "

    "### The Embedding Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "In Keras, the embedding matrix is represented as a \"layer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* The embedding matrix maps word indices to embedding vectors.\n",
    "    * The word indices are positive integers.\n",
    "    * The embedding vectors are dense vectors of fixed size.\n",
    "    * A \"dense\" vector is the opposite of a sparse vector. It means that most of its values are non-zero.  As a counter-example, a one-hot encoded vector is not \"dense.\"\n",
    "* The embedding matrix can be derived in two ways:\n",
    "    * Training a model to derive the embeddings from scratch. \n",
    "    * Using a pretrained embedding.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Using and Updating Pre-trained Embeddings\n",

    "\n",
    "* Initializing the Embedding layer with GloVe 50-dimensional vectors. \n",
    "* Keras allows we to either train or leave this layer fixed. Because your training set is quite small, we'll leave the GloVe embeddings fixed instead of updating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs and Outputs to the Embedding Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `Embedding()` layer's input is an integer matrix of size **(batch size, max input length)**. \n",
    "    * This input corresponds to sentences converted into lists of indices (integers).\n",
    "    * The largest integer (the highest word index) in the input should be no larger than the vocabulary size.\n",
    "* The embedding layer outputs an array of shape (batch size, max input length, dimension of word vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The figure shows the propagation of two example sentences through the embedding layer. \n",
    "    * Both examples have been zero-padded to a length of `max_len=5`.\n",
    "    * The word embeddings are 50 units in length.\n",
    "    * The final dimension of the representation is  `(2,max_len,50)`. \n",

    "- If you have an NLP task where the training set is small, using word embeddings can help your algorithm significantly. \n",
    "- Word embeddings allow your model to work on words in the test set that may not even appear in the training set. \n",
    "- Training sequence models in Keras (and in most other deep learning frameworks) requires a few important details:\n",
    "    - To use mini-batches, the sequences need to be **padded** so that all the examples in a mini-batch have the **same length**. \n",
    "    - An `Embedding()` layer can be initialized with pretrained values. \n",
    "        - These values can be either fixed or trained further on your dataset. \n",
    "        - If however your labeled dataset is small, it's usually not worth trying to train a large pre-trained set of embeddings.   \n",
    "    - `LSTM()` has a flag called `return_sequences` to decide if you would like to return all hidden states or only the last one. \n",
    "    - You can use `Dropout()` right after `LSTM()` to regularize your network. "
