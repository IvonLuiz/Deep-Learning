    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory.\" They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some contextual information through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time step to the next. This allows a unidirectional (one-way) RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional (two-way) RNN can take context from both the past and the future, much like Marty McFly. \n",

    "* Using language as an example, a language with a 5000-word vocabulary could be one-hot encoded into a vector that has 5000 units.  So $x^{(i)\\langle t \\rangle}$ would have the shape (5000,)  \n",

If, however, you are an expert in calculus (or are just curious) and want to see the details of backprop in RNNs, you can work through this optional portion of the notebook. \n",

Similarly, in recurrent neural networks you can calculate the derivatives with respect to the cost in order to update the parameters. The backprop equations are quite complicated, and so were not derived in lecture. However, they're briefly presented for your viewing pleasure below. \n",

It is further assumed that loss has been adjusted for batch size (m) and division by the number of examples is not required here.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Let's assume you are reading words in a piece of text, and plan to use an LSTM to keep track of grammatical structures, such as whether the subject is singular (\"puppy\") or plural (\"puppies\"). \n",
    "* If the subject changes its state (from a singular word to a plural word), the memory of the previous state becomes outdated, so you'll \"forget\" that outdated state.\n",
    "* The \"forget gate\" is a tensor containing values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    * If a unit in the forget gate has a value close to 0, the LSTM will \"forget\" the stored state in the corresponding unit of the previous cell state.\n",
    "    * If a unit in the forget gate has a value close to 1, the LSTM will mostly remember the corresponding value in the stored state.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Explanation of the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{W_{f}}$ contains weights that govern the forget gate's behavior. \n",
    "* The previous time step's hidden state $[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$ and current time step's input $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}]$ are concatenated together and multiplied by $\\mathbf{W_{f}}$. \n",
    "* A sigmoid function is used to make each of the gate tensor's values $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ range from 0 to 1.\n",
    "* The forget gate  $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ has the same dimensions as the previous cell state $c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$. \n",
    "* This means that the two can be multiplied together, element-wise.\n",
    "* Multiplying the tensors $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_f^{\\langle t \\rangle} * \\mathbf{c}^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$ is like applying a mask over the previous cell state.\n",
    "* If a single value in $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is 0 or close to 0, then the product is close to 0.\n",
    "    * This keeps the information stored in the corresponding unit in $\\mathbf{c}^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$ from being remembered for the next time step.\n",
    "* Similarly, if one value is close to 1, the product is close to the original value in the previous cell state.\n",

    "**Conclusions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* An LSTM is similar to an RNN in that they both use hidden states to pass along information, but an LSTM also uses a cell state, which is like a long-term memory, to help deal with the issue of vanishing gradients\n",
    "* An LSTM cell consists of a cell state, or long-term memory, a hidden state, or short-term memory, along with 3 gates that constantly update the relevancy of its inputs:\n",
    "    * A <b>forget</b> gate, which decides which input units should be remembered and passed along. It's a tensor with values between 0 and 1. \n",
    "        * If a unit has a value close to 0, the LSTM will \"forget\" the stored state in the previous cell state.\n",
    "        * If it has a value close to 1, the LSTM will mostly remember the corresponding value.\n",
    "    * An <b>update</b> gate, again a tensor containing values between 0 and 1. It decides on what information to throw away, and what new information to add.\n",
    "        * When a unit in the update gate is close to 1, the value of its candidate is passed on to the hidden state.\n",
    "        * When a unit in the update gate is close to 0, it's prevented from being passed onto the hidden state.\n",
    "    * And an <b>output</b> gate, which decides what gets sent as the output of the time step"

    "\n",
    "    - Note that the value that's set to `p` should be set to a 1D vector.\n",
    "    - Also notice that $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t+1 \\rangle}$, which is `y` in the code, is a 2D array.\n",
    "    - Also notice, while in your implementation, the first argument to `np.random.choice` is just an ordered list [0,1,.., vocab_len-1], it is *not* appropriate to use `char_to_ix.values()`.
