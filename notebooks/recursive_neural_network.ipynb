    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory.\" They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some contextual information through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time step to the next. This allows a unidirectional (one-way) RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional (two-way) RNN can take context from both the past and the future, much like Marty McFly. \n",

    "### Dimensions of input $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input with $n_x$ number of units\n",
    "* For a single time step of a single input example, $x^{(i) \\langle t \\rangle }$ is a one-dimensional input vector\n",
    "* Using language as an example, a language with a 5000-word vocabulary could be one-hot encoded into a vector that has 5000 units.  So $x^{(i)\\langle t \\rangle}$ would have the shape (5000,)  \n",
    "* The notation $n_x$ is used here to denote the number of units in a single time step of a single training example\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time steps of size $T_{x}$\n",
    "* A recurrent neural network has multiple time steps, which you'll index with $t$.\n",
    "* In the lessons, you saw a single training example $x^{(i)}$ consisting of multiple time steps $T_x$. In this notebook, $T_{x}$ will denote the number of timesteps in the longest sequence.\n",

    "#### Batches of size $m$\n",
    "* Let's say we have mini-batches, each with 20 training examples  \n",

    "* For example, this tensor has the shape (5000,20,10) \n",

    "* At each time step, you'll use a mini-batch of training examples (not just a single example)\n",
    "* So, for each time step $t$, you'll use a 2D slice of shape $(n_x,m)$\n",

    "* If you include a mini-batch of $m$ training examples, the shape of a mini-batch is $(n_{a},m)$\n",
    "* When you include the time step dimension, the shape of the hidden state is $(n_{a}, m, T_x)$\n",
    "* You'll loop through the time steps with index $t$, and work with a 2D slice of the 3D tensor  \n",
    "* This 2D slice is referred to as $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$\n",
    "* In the code, the variable names used are either `a_prev` or `a_next`, depending on the function being implemented\n",
    "* The shape of this 2D slice is $(n_{a}, m)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensions of prediction $\\hat{y}$\n",
    "* Similar to the inputs and hidden states, $\\hat{y}$ is a 3D tensor of shape $(n_{y}, m, T_{y})$\n",
    "    * $n_{y}$: number of units in the vector representing the prediction\n",
    "    * $m$: number of examples in a mini-batch\n",
    "    * $T_{y}$: number of time steps in the prediction\n",
    "* For a single time step $t$, a 2D slice $\\hat{y}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ has shape $(n_{y}, m)$\n",
    "* In the code, the variable names are:\n",
