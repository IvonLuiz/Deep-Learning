    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory.\" They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some contextual information through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time step to the next. This allows a unidirectional (one-way) RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional (two-way) RNN can take context from both the past and the future, much like Marty McFly. \n",

    "* Using language as an example, a language with a 5000-word vocabulary could be one-hot encoded into a vector that has 5000 units.  So $x^{(i)\\langle t \\rangle}$ would have the shape (5000,)  \n",

If, however, you are an expert in calculus (or are just curious) and want to see the details of backprop in RNNs, you can work through this optional portion of the notebook. \n",

Similarly, in recurrent neural networks you can calculate the derivatives with respect to the cost in order to update the parameters. The backprop equations are quite complicated, and so were not derived in lecture. However, they're briefly presented for your viewing pleasure below. \n",

    "Note that this notebook does not implement the backward path from the Loss 'J' backwards to 'a'. This would have included the dense layer and softmax, which are a part of the forward path.

It is further assumed that loss has been adjusted for batch size (m) and division by the number of examples is not required here.\n",
