    "### Equalization Algorithm for Gender-Specific Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's see how debiasing can also be applied to word pairs such as \"actress\" and \"actor.\" Equalization is applied to pairs of words that you might want to have differ only through the gender property. As a concrete example, suppose that \"actress\" is closer to \"babysit\" than \"actor.\" By applying neutralization to \"babysit,\" you can reduce the gender stereotype associated with babysitting. But this still does not guarantee that \"actor\" and \"actress\" are equidistant from \"babysit.\" The equalization algorithm takes care of this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind equalization is to make sure that a particular pair of words are equidistant from the 49-dimensional $g_\\perp$. The equalization step also ensures that the two equalized steps are now the same distance from $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$, or from any other work that has been neutralized. Visually, this is how equalization works: \n",
